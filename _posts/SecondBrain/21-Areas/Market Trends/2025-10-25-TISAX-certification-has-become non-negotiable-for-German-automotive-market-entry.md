# TISAX certification has become non-negotiable for German automotive market entry

TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) is a **mandatory prerequisite** for doing business with German automotive OEMs, not a competitive advantage. Without TISAX certification, suppliers face immediate exclusion from RFPs, cannot access sensitive technical data or prototypes, and risk losing existing contracts at renewal. All major German OEMs—BMW, Volkswagen Group, and Mercedes-Benz—now require **Assessment Level 3 (AL3)** certification from cybersecurity software providers, with no documented exemptions for pilot projects or proof-of-concepts. The certification process requires **6-12 months** and costs **€25,000-€200,000** depending on organizational maturity, but companies can claim "TISAX in progress" status immediately upon ENX portal registration, providing interim business continuity during the certification period. Of seven major automotive cybersecurity competitors analyzed, only **three hold TISAX certification** (ESCRYPT, Vector Informatik, Upstream Security), while the remaining four Israeli-based competitors (Argus/PlaxidityX, Guardknox, Cymotive, Karamba Security) show no evidence of certification despite operating in Germany. ISO 27001 provides a strong foundation covering 70-80% of TISAX requirements and can reduce preparation costs by 20-30%, but cannot substitute for TISAX with German OEMs—both certifications are increasingly required together.

## German OEMs treat TISAX as contractual requirement, not optional standard

The transformation of TISAX from voluntary framework to mandatory requirement occurred between 2019-2023, with enforcement accelerating significantly in 2024-2025. Volkswagen Group declared in 2023 that "we are one of the first vehicle manufacturers to require our suppliers to have passed TISAX certification," mandating all P-suppliers complete implementation by June 30, 2024. Mercedes-Benz/Daimler Truck requires **AL3 certification at all supplier locations** with eight specific assessment objectives including "strictly confidential," "proto vehicles," and "special data." BMW requires AL3 from Tier-1 suppliers and software developers, with industry sources stating "if the goal is to become a tier-1 provider to BMW or other industry leaders, this will require them to achieve the highest level."

For cybersecurity software providers specifically, the standard industry expectation is **AL3 (Very High Protection Needs)**, not the lower AL2 level. This reflects the sensitive nature of security-related intellectual property and system architectures these companies handle. The assessment level determines audit rigor: AL2 involves remote documentation reviews via video conference costing €5,000-€15,000, while AL3 requires comprehensive on-site audits with physical security inspections costing €10,000-€50,000 and taking 2-4 days on-site plus extensive preparation.

Recent updates to VDA ISA Version 6.0 (mandatory since April 2024) have strengthened requirements significantly. The new framework separates confidentiality and availability into distinct objectives, expands from two to four assessment levels, and introduces enhanced cybersecurity controls targeting ransomware and advanced persistent threats. These changes directly respond to **409 automotive cybersecurity incidents in 2024** (up from 295 in 2023), with 60% being data/privacy-related. The heightened threat landscape has intensified OEM enforcement of TISAX requirements across their entire supply chain.

The requirement extends beyond geographic boundaries—non-EU suppliers face identical requirements with no special provisions. Industry experts note "any organization that works with a European automotive company and deals with sensitive information could be asked to comply with TISAX, even if they are based outside of Europe." North American suppliers have seen particularly strong pressure in recent months, with sources describing a "surge in interest in TISAX across the Americas' automotive supply chain."

## Suppliers without TISAX face immediate exclusion from contracts and data access

The business impact of lacking TISAX certification is severe and immediate. ZF Group, a major Tier-1 supplier, explicitly states in supplier letters that "maintenance of a proper TISAX certification in SupplyOn Business Directory is a **condition of sourcing**"—not a preference or nice-to-have. ZF requires AL3 from all suppliers who obtain sensitive documentation, access ZF IT systems, or handle prototypes. This cascading effect means TISAX requirements now flow down from OEMs through Tier-1 suppliers to Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers. Bosch and ZF both mandate TISAX from their supplier base, creating a multiplier effect throughout the supply chain.

Documented case studies reveal the practical consequences. QFD Group, a Tier-1 electronics manufacturer, faced the reality that "acquisition of the TISAX label was also a **deadline requirement for the nomination of the new project**"—without TISAX, the company would have been excluded from project consideration entirely. Industry sources consistently describe TISAX as a filtering mechanism: "BMW and Audi will choose suppliers with TISAX certification over German suppliers, especially small-to-medium firms, who lack the certification."

The restrictions on data sharing are absolute and immediate. OEMs require TISAX certification **before contracting**, not during or after. TÜV SÜD states that "OEMs will want to ensure that their suppliers and partners have a solid information security management system in place **BEFORE they are contracted**." A US-based software company case study illustrates this: "asked by a German automaker to process vehicle telemetry data, the automaker requires TISAX certification **before signing the contract**." There are no documented grace periods, trial engagements, or pilot project exemptions.

Specifically, companies cannot access technical drawings and specifications, prototype vehicles or parts, strictly confidential development data, or critical vehicle system information without appropriate TISAX labels. Any work involving sensitive automotive data requires TISAX from day one. An R&D consultancy example shows that "developing advanced driver-assistance systems for multiple OEMs is asked to certify to TISAX AL3 because of the highly sensitive nature of the project data."

The timeline pressure creates significant business risk. With **12-18 months** required for AL2 certification and **up to 3 years** for AL3, companies without TISAX face extended periods locked out of new business opportunities. The 9-month window from closing meeting to completion of the entire assessment process is rigid—missing this deadline requires **restarting the entire process from the beginning**. This creates a dangerous business scenario where companies losing their TISAX label or pursuing initial certification face potential 12-36 month gaps in market access.

## Competitor landscape reveals strategic divide on TISAX certification approach

Analysis of seven major automotive cybersecurity competitors operating in Germany reveals a striking pattern: **only 43% (3 of 7) hold TISAX certification**, creating a clear strategic divide in the market.

The three TISAX-certified competitors position their certification prominently:

**ESCRYPT (ETAS/Bosch)** achieved TISAX certification in November 2020 across all German branches, passing with what auditors called "exemplary status." As a German company fully integrated into Bosch/ETAS, ESCRYPT features TISAX prominently in press releases with "flying colors" language and positions it as validation of their security processes. Their certification timing—within three years of TISAX establishment in 2017—suggests proactive strategic positioning.

**Vector Informatik**, another German company, holds **AL3 certification** (the highest level) covering Stuttgart, Regensburg, Karlsruhe, and Munich locations. Vector provides extensive technical transparency, publishing their Scope ID (S4RXT9) and Participation ID (P96MWR) on their About Vector page alongside ISO 9001 and Automotive SPICE certifications. They explicitly state availability to share positive Assessment Level 3 results via ENX portal upon request, treating TISAX as a core quality credential.

**Upstream Security**, an Israeli company with international operations, also holds AL3 certification and positions TISAX first among certifications on their dedicated Security & Compliance page. They provide clear instructions for accessing their assessment results via the ENX portal and emphasize compliance with "the highest standards of security, reliability, privacy and compliance in the industry."

The four competitors without TISAX certification—all Israeli-based companies—take a markedly different approach. **Argus Cyber Security** (now PlaxidityX after Continental AG acquisition for $430 million) relies on ISO/SAE 21434:2021 certification obtained by parent company Continental in June 2023. Despite being part of a major German automotive supplier, no TISAX certification evidence exists. **Guardknox** emphasizes ISO/SAE 21434 compliance, ISO 26262 (up to ASIL D), and UNECE R155 compliance, positioning themselves through their founding team's Israeli Air Force cybersecurity credentials and participation in ISO/SAE 21434 standards development rather than certification holdings.

**Cymotive Technologies**, a joint venture backed by Volkswagen and co-founded by three former Israeli Shin Bet security agency figures, shows no TISAX certification despite the Volkswagen relationship. Instead, Cymotive positions as helping other companies achieve UNR 155/156 compliance, emphasizing their "elite cybersecurity specialists" and consulting capabilities. **Karamba Security** similarly focuses on enabling customers to meet regulations rather than holding certifications themselves, marketing "meet industry regulations with no R&D interference" and zero false positives in automated security integration.

This strategic divide reveals two distinct market positioning approaches: **certification-led** (ESCRYPT, Vector, Upstream) versus **expertise-led** (Guardknox, Cymotive, Karamba, Argus/PlaxidityX). The certification-led companies display credentials prominently as trust signals and competitive differentiators, while expertise-led companies leverage founder credentials, standards participation, and product innovation over formal assessments. The German-headquartered companies universally hold TISAX, while Israeli companies with German operations show mixed approaches—suggesting TISAX may be less critical for companies positioning as elite consultancies helping others achieve compliance rather than operating as embedded suppliers handling OEM data directly.

## TISAX certification achievable in 6-12 months with strategic "in progress" status available immediately

The certification process follows three distinct phases with clear timelines and deliverables. **Phase 1: Registration** requires 3-5 days and €400-700 to complete ENX portal registration, define assessment scope, select objectives, and receive Participant ID and Scope ID. **Phase 2: Assessment** spans 4-12 months depending on maturity and includes self-assessment (1-6 months), audit provider selection (2-4 weeks), initial assessment execution, corrective actions if needed (up to 9 months deadline), and follow-up verification. **Phase 3: Exchange** begins immediately upon label issuance, with 3-year validity and annual fees of €1,000-€3,000.

Total cost investment varies significantly by company size and maturity. Small companies (1 location, AL2) face **€25,000-€60,000** initial costs plus €15,000-€30,000 annually. Medium companies (2-3 locations, AL3) require **€60,000-€120,000** initially plus €25,000-€45,000 annually. Large organizations (5+ locations, AL3) need **€100,000-€200,000** initially plus €35,000-€70,000 annually. These totals include ENX registration (€400-700), audit fees (€5,000-€50,000), optional consultant fees (€10,000-€100,000), and internal implementation costs (€30,000-€200,000).

TÜV Nord, one of approximately 14 ENX-approved TISAX audit providers in Germany, offers both TISAX assessments and ISO 27001 certification services. Other major approved providers include DEKRA (with 200+ accreditations), DQS GmbH, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV SÜD, Bureau Veritas, and Big 4 firms (Deloitte, EY, KPMG). Selection criteria should consider geographic presence (local auditors reduce travel costs), language capabilities, availability/lead time, and whether the provider has previously consulted for your organization (impartiality requirements prohibit providers who consulted from also auditing).

Prerequisites for starting TISAX include management commitment and budget allocation, established ISMS with maturity level 3 minimum across key controls, comprehensive documentation covering 20+ information security policies, technical infrastructure (IAM, firewalls, encryption, monitoring), dedicated Information Security Officer/CISO, and completed security awareness training. The timeline varies dramatically based on starting maturity: **12-18 months** with no existing ISMS, **6-9 months** with ISO 27001 already in place, or as fast as **4 months** with an excellent mature ISMS.

Critical to FESCARO's business case: **companies CAN claim "TISAX in progress" status immediately upon registration**. The official TISAX Participant Handbook explicitly confirms: "You can in fact share your 'assessment result' even if you haven't started the assessment process yet. At this early stage, you are just sharing the 'assessment status'. The participant with whom you share your 'assessment result' will see where you are in the assessment process." Partners can view assessment scope status levels including "Awaiting your order," "Registered/Approved," "Assessment in progress," and "Corrective actions in progress."

This interim status sharing provides substantial business benefits during the 6-12 month certification period. It demonstrates commitment to information security, shows active progress toward certification, maintains business relationships, satisfies interim requirements from automotive OEMs, and provides competitive advantage over non-certified suppliers. Companies should communicate proactively with OEM partners using language like "Currently undergoing TISAX assessment (expected completion: Q2 2025)" or "Registered TISAX participant (Scope ID: XXXXXX)" while avoiding premature claims of being "TISAX certified" or "TISAX compliant."

Additionally, **temporary TISAX labels** become available after corrective action plan approval if the initial assessment finds only minor non-conformities. These temporary labels provide full TISAX label functionality for up to 9 months, are accepted by automotive partners under condition of later permanent labels, and are shareable via ENX portal. This creates a viable path for companies to secure interim business access while completing final remediation—effectively compressing time-to-market while maintaining compliance trajectory.

The 9-month deadline from initial assessment closing meeting to completion of entire assessment process is rigid and mandatory. Missing this deadline requires restarting the entire process, creating significant business risk. Companies should target achieving at least maturity level 3 across all applicable controls before scheduling initial assessment to minimize likelihood of major non-conformities that could extend timelines.

## ISO 27001 provides foundation but cannot substitute for mandatory TISAX requirement

ISO 27001 and TISAX share fundamental architectural similarities—TISAX is based on ISO 27001 with **90% of TISAX's Information Security module derived directly from ISO 27001 Annex A controls**. The VDA ISA catalog (Version 6.0) uses ISO 27001:2022 as its primary reference point, with explicit columns in the assessment framework referencing ISO 27001 controls and implementation guidance. Both frameworks share risk management approaches, ISMS structure, access control measures, incident management, business continuity planning, and continuous improvement principles (PDCA cycle).

However, critical differences prevent substitution. German OEMs universally require TISAX labels from suppliers—industry sources definitively state "only the TISAX result is decisive" and "automotive suppliers don't necessarily need ISO 27001 certification to operate as part of the supply chain." ISO 27001 alone is insufficient for market access. The fundamental structural differences include:

ISO 27001 is a traditional public certification applicable across industries, while TISAX is an automotive industry-specific assessment label shared only through the ENX portal with public advertising prohibited. ISO 27001 uses binary compliance assessment (compliant or non-compliant), while TISAX employs a three-level approach (AL1 self-assessment, AL2 remote audit, AL3 on-site audit) with maturity ratings from 0-5 requiring minimum level 3 achievement. ISO 27001 allows flexible scope definition (specific sites or product lines), while TISAX requires location-based labels covering entire company sites with no exclusions. ISO 27001 requires three-year validity with mandatory annual surveillance audits, while TISAX offers three-year validity with no annual surveillance requirements.

Most significantly, **TISAX includes automotive-specific requirements absent from ISO 27001**: prototype protection (physical and logical security for pre-production parts, components, vehicles including camouflage during public road testing), enhanced data protection (dedicated GDPR/privacy module beyond ISO 27001 requirements), and stricter supply chain security guidelines specific to automotive manufacturing networks.

Despite inability to substitute, ISO 27001 serves as a powerful stepping stone. Organizations with ISO 27001 certification "generally face lower costs" for TISAX and can "close TISAX requirements in a few weeks with common control mapping." Industry experts confirm "any company that has successfully undergone a company-wide ISO 27001 audit will have little trouble passing TISAX." The efficiency gains are substantial: pursuing both certifications together saves **20-30% of total costs** compared to sequential pursuit, with combined investment of €15,000-€35,000 versus €15,000-€45,000 separately.

Companies with pre-existing ISO 27001 can reuse extensive documentation including risk assessments, security policies, access control procedures, incident response plans, business continuity plans, and training materials. Staff familiarity with ISMS concepts and existing audit experience significantly reduces the learning curve. Some audit providers approved for both standards can schedule assessments close together, and sources confirm "both standards can be assessed at the same time and with less additional effort."

The optimal strategic path for organizations seeking German automotive market access is implementing ISO 27001 first as foundation (if not already certified), conducting gap analysis for TISAX-specific requirements, adding automotive controls (prototype protection, enhanced data protection), and then pursuing TISAX assessment at appropriate level. This combined approach positions companies for both automotive and non-automotive markets, with ISO 27001 certificate providing public marketing value that TISAX labels cannot (due to private sharing restrictions).

Some exceptional cases require dual certification—"many automotive companies recommend or require both certifications" and "some OEMs will expect a supplier to prove compliance with ISO 27001 in addition to TISAX." PACCAR represents a rare exception, stating they mandate TISAX AL3 labels but "alternatively, an ISO 27001 certificate covering the relevant products and services may also be accepted." However, this remains exceptional—the industry standard is TISAX as mandatory with ISO 27001 as optional foundation.

## Strategic implications for FESCARO's business case

The research yields five critical strategic implications for FESCARO's market positioning and certification investment decision:

**First, TISAX certification is a market access requirement, not a competitive differentiator.** The business case should frame TISAX investment as prerequisite infrastructure cost rather than optional enhancement. Without TISAX AL3, FESCARO cannot access RFPs from BMW, VW Group, or Mercedes-Benz, cannot handle prototype data or strictly confidential development information, and faces immediate disadvantage against the 43% of competitors already certified (ESCRYPT, Vector, Upstream). The investment timeline requires starting 12-18 months before targeting OEM contracts to avoid missing project nomination deadlines.

**Second, "TISAX in progress" status provides immediate interim value.** Upon ENX portal registration (3-5 days, €400-700), FESCARO can share assessment status with potential OEM partners, demonstrating active commitment to compliance. This addresses the critical 6-12 month gap between business development activities and label issuance. Temporary TISAX labels (available after initial assessment with minor non-conformities) provide full functionality for up to 9 months during remediation, enabling contract eligibility while completing final requirements.

**Third, ISO 27001 certification should be pursued in parallel or first.** With 70-80% requirement overlap and 20-30% cost reduction potential, ISO 27001 provides optimal foundation. The combined approach reduces TISAX preparation time from 12-18 months to 6-9 months and lowers total investment by €5,000-€15,000. Additionally, ISO 27001 serves as publicly marketable credential (unlike TISAX's private exchange model) and opens non-automotive markets, providing diversification value beyond automotive sector.

**Fourth, AL3 certification is the appropriate target level.** As a cybersecurity software provider handling security-related intellectual property and system architectures, FESCARO falls into the "standard industry expectation: AL3" category. The research shows software developers and ECU developers face AL3 requirements from major OEMs, and Tier-1 suppliers universally require AL3. Pursuing AL2 would require re-certification to AL3 within 12-24 months as business relationships deepen, resulting in duplicate investment.

**Fifth, competitive positioning benefits from early certification.** With only 43% of analyzed competitors holding TISAX (3 of 7), early certification provides differentiation window before certification becomes universal. The certified competitors (ESCRYPT, Vector, Upstream) all position TISAX prominently in marketing materials as trust signal and quality credential. The four non-certified competitors rely on alternative positioning (standards participation, founder credentials, consulting services) that may prove insufficient as OEM enforcement intensifies. The 409 cybersecurity incidents in 2024 (up 39% from 2023) suggest OEM requirements will continue strengthening, making early compliance strategically advantageous.

The total investment requirement of **€60,000-€120,000** for medium-sized company AL3 certification plus **€25,000-€45,000** annually represents substantial but necessary market access cost. The alternative—exclusion from German automotive OEM business—carries far higher opportunity cost given the market size and strategic value of BMW, VW Group, and Mercedes-Benz relationships. The business case should emphasize that this investment enables access to contracts worth multiples of certification cost while positioning FESCARO for long-term growth in automotive cybersecurity sector where TISAX has become the de facto industry standard.
