## 🔴 CRITICAL CORRECTION: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Initial Understanding (From Booth Conversation) - INCOMPLETE

The original booth conversation analysis positioned AUMOVIO as a **consulting services company** with potential partnership opportunities. While the conversation intelligence was accurate, it **missed AUMOVIO's primary business model**: they are a **HARDWARE MANUFACTURER** first, with consulting services as a secondary offering.

### Corrected Understanding (From Website Analysis) - COMPLETE

**AUMOVIO Engineering Solutions is a Continental AG spin-off (September 2025 IPO) that manufactures physical gateway ECU hardware devices for agricultural machinery and off-highway vehicles, with consulting services as a complementary business line.**

**PRIMARY BUSINESS (Revenue Driver):**

- Gateway ECU hardware manufacturing
- Physical devices: Zone Control Units, Compact Gateways, Smart Gateways, Power Gateways, High Performance Gateways
- Each gateway ECU currently integrates **chip-level hardware HSMs** from suppliers like NXP
- Production volumes: estimated 10,000-50,000+ units annually

**SECONDARY BUSINESS (Service Layer):**

- Systems engineering consulting
- Verification & validation testing services
- CRA compliance consulting
- Process establishment and training

### Strategic Implication: FROM CONSULTING PARTNER TO HARDWARE CUSTOMER

**Original Assessment (WRONG):** "AUMOVIO represents a high-value consulting services partner with potential for joint go-to-market in agricultural machinery cybersecurity compliance."

**Corrected Assessment (RIGHT):** "AUMOVIO represents FESCARO's **highest-priority hardware customer target** with potential for volume licensing of software HSM to replace expensive chip-level hardware HSMs in their gateway ECU product line, plus strategic partnership opportunities for joint OEM solutions."

**Why This Changes Everything:**

|Dimension|Original Understanding|Corrected Understanding|
|---|---|---|
|**Business Relationship**|Consulting partner/competitor|Direct hardware customer + partner|
|**Revenue Model**|Joint service delivery (€500K-1.5M)|Volume licensing (€200K-1.7M+) + partnership|
|**Market Access**|Shared consulting clients|OEM multiplier effect (every AUMOVIO gateway = FESCARO presence)|
|**Value Proposition**|Complementary consulting services|Direct cost reduction (30-50% BOM savings)|
|**Urgency**|Partnership nice-to-have|Cost reduction business case urgent|
|**Priority**|A-Tier|**A+ Tier**|

## PART 1: BOOTH CONVERSATION INTELLIGENCE

### (Original Analysis - Remains Valid for Consulting Services Understanding)

### Recording Context & Methodology

**Source Data:** Multiple AI transcription tools produced variant transcripts with approximately 75% overlap due to booth environment noise and technical terminology. Cross-referencing linguistic patterns and timestamp markers reveals the following most likely scenario.

**Duration:** Approximately 7 minutes  
**Setting:** AUMOVIO booth (Halle 17 - C14), standing conversation near display materials  
**Participants:**

- **Benedikt Müller** (AUMOVIO): Senior Project & Business Development Manager
- **Jo SeungHyeon** (FESCARO): Market Research Consultant

**Conversation Tone:** Professional, exploratory, increasingly detailed as technical depth emerged

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:** The conversation focused on AUMOVIO's **consulting services** (Benedikt's role) and did not deeply explore their **hardware manufacturing business**. This created an incomplete picture that has been corrected through website analysis.

### Conversation Flow - Detailed Reconstruction

#### **[00:00-01:02] Opening: AUMOVIO Service Portfolio Overview**

**AUMOVIO Representative (Benedikt Müller):** "It's a lot to cover at the moment. But over the development timeline... We have several different services that we offer. So, one point is that we have our own components. We have to make sure that they are safety and functional safety and cybersecurity - like everything is included. But on the other hand, we are offering these services also for the system level and on vehicle level for customers depending on if you are having a new startup then we can start with benchmarking and analysis."

**🔴 CORRECTION: What "Our Own Components" Actually Means:**

**Initial Interpretation:** Software components or consulting frameworks  
**Actual Meaning:** Physical gateway ECU hardware devices that AUMOVIO manufactures

**Key Intelligence - Multi-Level Business Model:**

1. **Component Level (HARDWARE MANUFACTURING - PRIMARY BUSINESS):**
    
    - Zone Control Units with e-fuses and power distribution
    - Gateway ECUs (5 product lines) with embedded hardware HSMs
    - Physical devices sold to OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers
2. **System Level (CONSULTING SERVICES - SECONDARY BUSINESS):**
    
    - Integration services for OEMs
    - E/E architecture design
    - Cybersecurity concept development
3. **Vehicle Level (CONSULTING SERVICES):**
    
    - Complete vehicle CSMS implementation
    - Testing and validation services
4. **Startup Services (CONSULTING SERVICES):**
    
    - Benchmarking and gap analysis
    - Training and process establishment

**Strategic Implication for FESCARO (REVISED):**

**Original:** "AUMOVIO positions as one-stop-shop for agricultural machinery cybersecurity - creates partnership opportunity where FESCARO's embedded security products integrate into AUMOVIO's service delivery framework."

**Corrected:** "AUMOVIO manufactures gateway ECU hardware that currently uses expensive chip-level hardware HSMs. FESCARO's software HSM represents a **direct cost reduction opportunity** for AUMOVIO's gateway manufacturing business (30-50% BOM savings per unit), with potential for **volume licensing** across their production. The consulting services represent a secondary partnership opportunity for joint OEM solutions."

**Benedikt continues:** "And most of the big OEMs they don't need someone like that. So we have different starting points like EE architecture for example. And everything you see here - the whole scope of the service - going into the recycling. These are all the definition concept base or the pre-work that you're doing and then going into the testing area going to recycle up again. So, this is all separated also from our components. We offer this to every OEM, every vehicle manufacturer who needs something like that."

**Critical Distinction:**

- **Large OEMs (John Deere, AGCO, CNH):** Already have internal cybersecurity teams, but **MAY STILL BUY AUMOVIO GATEWAY HARDWARE**
- **Mid-Tier OEMs (Amazonen-Werke, Horsch, Lemken, Grimme):** Buy AUMOVIO gateway hardware + consulting services
- **Tier 2/3 Suppliers:** Consulting services customers (FESCARO's consulting sweet spot)

**🔴 REVISED FESCARO Opportunity:** Mid-tier agricultural OEMs are **cost-sensitive**. If FESCARO's software HSM is integrated into AUMOVIO's gateway ECUs, the value proposition becomes:

- **Hardware cost reduction:** €40-70 savings per gateway ECU (software HSM vs. chip-level hardware HSM)
- **Lifecycle flexibility:** Software-updatable security over 15-20 year agricultural machinery lifecycles
- **Price competitiveness:** AUMOVIO can offer lower gateway prices than competitors using expensive hardware HSMs
- **Customer retention:** AUMOVIO's gateway customers become FESCARO's indirect customers

#### **[01:02-01:55] Jo's Probe: Continental Heritage & Technology Transfer**

**Jo:** "As I know you are actually branch out from the Continental, am I right?"

**Benedikt:** "Correct."

**Jo:** "So, you must have some kind of experience from the automotive industry and you must be a very expert about the cyber security among in the automotive industry as well. While bringing some experience and know-how from that industry to the agricultural industry, do you see any difference or is it very beneficial to adapting those kind of technology?"

**Strategic Context of Question:** Jo's question mirrors FESCARO's exact market entry strategy: **Korean automotive cybersecurity expertise → European agricultural machinery market**. This creates immediate credibility and shared understanding of technology transfer challenges.

**Benedikt's Response (Critical Intelligence):** "I mean, first of all, yes, there are some similarities. But then it's different business and we use component use parts or expertise but we don't... because if you take you just try to recognize it to make it an offered photo usually it doesn't work because the needs are very different from from the core."

**Key Intelligence - Technology Transfer Complexity:**

**Similarities Identified:**

- Embedded systems architecture (CAN/LIN networks, ECUs, safety-critical functions)
- ISO/SAE 21434 framework principles apply to ISO 24882
- Secure boot, cryptographic key management, OTA update mechanisms
- Supply chain cybersecurity management (SBOM, vulnerability tracking)

**Differences Noted:**

- **Product lifecycle:** Agricultural machinery = 15-20 years vs. Automotive = 7-10 years (crypto-agility requirements differ)
- **Operational environment:** Remote rural areas, limited connectivity, harsh conditions
- **Safety criticality profiles:** Different failure mode hierarchies
- **Market structure:** Agricultural OEMs less vertically integrated than automotive

**🔴 REVISED IMPLICATION FOR FESCARO SOFTWARE HSM:** The 15-20 year agricultural lifecycle is **perfectly suited** for FESCARO's software HSM value proposition:

- **Hardware HSM limitation:** Cryptographic algorithms fixed at manufacturing, cannot be updated
- **Software HSM advantage:** Algorithm agility over product lifetime, security patches deployable via OTA
- **AUMOVIO benefit:** Can market "future-proof security" vs. competitors' fixed hardware HSMs

**Benedikt continues:** "So yeah we have two entities - the one dedicated to the road vehicle or click and the one very... off-Highway representing right now. We build or on for it... we don't share forex with the other entities because usually it doesn't fit the market."

**Key Intelligence - Organizational Structure:**

- **AUMOVIO has separate business units:** Automotive vs. Off-Highway (agricultural/construction)
- **No shared product offerings between divisions** - market-specific customization philosophy
- **Off-Highway division autonomy** - separate P&L, separate technical roadmap

**🔴 STRATEGIC IMPLICATION FOR FESCARO:**

- AUMOVIO's agricultural division has **independent procurement authority**
- Can make technology decisions without automotive division approval
- Faster partnership negotiations (no cross-division consensus required)
- Gateway ECU product roadmap decisions made within agricultural division

---

#### **[01:55-03:30] Technical Deep-Dive: CRA Compliance Services**

**Jo:** "So, in here I see that you offer some CRA compliance training for those kind of OEMs. So, what exactly is the process, just literally explaining what the CRA is about?"

**Benedikt:** "Basically like gap analysis from the existing systems. And there is also what is required, what the requirements are as a normal... And we have now started to define what are the differences for the automotive industry and on the other side what are the differences for agriculture. We collect information from everywhere and at the end we can just present out where are your actual things - but the final goal is to have the action log and tell them what is missing. They have their own system which should then be supported over with so which are like activities which the customer can perform themselves. But just in general to say what actions have to be to fulfill the requirements and also to show how can it be tested and support the testing also in validation or so."

**Key Intelligence - AUMOVIO's CRA Service Offering:**

**Phase 1: Gap Analysis**

- Compare existing agricultural machinery systems against CRA requirements
- Sector-specific analysis (automotive vs. agricultural differences documented)
- "Information collection from everywhere" = active research/intelligence gathering phase
- **🔴 NOTE:** Gap analysis likely includes **cybersecurity architecture review** → opportunity to identify hardware HSM cost optimization

**Phase 2: Action Plan Development**

- Document gaps in compliance
- Prioritize remediation activities
- Create actionable roadmap
- **🔴 OPPORTUNITY:** Action plans could recommend AUMOVIO gateway ECUs with FESCARO software HSM as cost-effective compliance solution

**Phase 3: Implementation Support**

- Customer can self-implement with AUMOVIO guidance
- Testing and validation services available
- **🔴 OPPORTUNITY:** AUMOVIO's testing services could validate FESCARO software HSM integration in customer systems

**Phase 4: Ongoing Compliance**

- Training programs for customer teams
- Knowledge transfer to enable self-sufficiency
- **🔴 OPPORTUNITY:** Joint AUMOVIO-FESCARO training on secure gateway architecture with software HSM

**Jo:** "Do you also offer ISO 24882 kind of services to them?"

**Benedikt:** "Exactly that's what it is for. And again there are different levels that we can go in. It's just say, OK it's analysis and with these needs then the customer is having their own processes that they can do the work themselves. Or we are also offering to support them with processes - with requirements that you have to fulfill. Like if you want to do software development you need some requirements that you can test it. And other parts like testing. So we are completely flexible in there."

**Critical Market Intelligence:**

**Flexibility Model Analysis:**

|Service Tier|Customer Profile|AUMOVIO Involvement|FESCARO Integration Opportunity|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tier 1: Consulting Only**|Large OEMs with internal teams|Gap analysis + action plan|FESCARO products specified in action plan|
|**Tier 2: Guided Implementation**|Mid-tier OEMs with some capability|Process definition + guidance|Joint AUMOVIO-FESCARO process templates|
|**Tier 3: Full Service**|Small OEMs/Tier 1 suppliers|End-to-end implementation|AUMOVIO gateways + FESCARO software HSM turnkey|

**ISO 24882 Expertise Validation:** Benedikt's immediate, confident response to ISO 24882 question confirms AUMOVIO has deep agricultural cybersecurity standard knowledge. This makes them a **credible partner** for FESCARO's agricultural market entry (FESCARO can leverage AUMOVIO's standard expertise).

**🔴 CRITICAL: Hardware-Software Integration Opportunity** AUMOVIO's "completely flexible" service model means they can offer:

- **Option A (Hardware Only):** AUMOVIO gateway ECUs with standard hardware HSM
- **Option B (Software-Enhanced):** AUMOVIO gateway ECUs with FESCARO software HSM (lower price, better features)
- **Option C (Complete Solution):** AUMOVIO gateway hardware + FESCARO software HSM + AUMOVIO testing/validation services

Option B and C create **joint revenue opportunities** where AUMOVIO benefits from lower gateway costs (more competitive pricing) and FESCARO gains volume licensing revenue.

#### **[03:30-04:45] Market Readiness Assessment**

**Jo:** "So, among those OEMs in the agricultural industry, are they actually ready to follow these requirements? Do they actually understand the... the cyber security or is it just very raw point, they have to just get these certificates?"

**Benedikt:** "I mean there are... I think there are some differences again. We have some very big OEMs in the construction industry that they have very high expertise in IT but not for the OT side which is more operational technology. So that is something where we are coming like that we have our expertise from, again, from the old team but like that we know how the OT works - where are the differences. And we can combine those to... And then on the other side, there are OEMs that are very small and don't have any of that knowledge in the house. Then that's just... We offer, like I showed you... we have all these different cases that we can offer to say, OK, starting from the beginning, because usually you start with an existing product and then... But you can also start complete new and then you give advice for all these things and bring it up and then you end up with you have your product."

**Critical Market Segmentation Intelligence:**

**OEM Cybersecurity Maturity Matrix:**

|OEM Size/Type|IT Security|OT Security|AUMOVIO Value|FESCARO Opportunity|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Large Construction OEMs**|High|Low|OT expertise|Embedded security products|
|**Mid-Tier Agricultural OEMs**|Medium|Low|Both IT & OT|Complete security solutions|
|**Small Specialized OEMs**|Low|Very Low|Complete support|Turnkey hardware+software|

**IT vs. OT Knowledge Gap:**

- **IT Security:** Enterprise cybersecurity, cloud security, network firewalls (CISOs understand this)
- **OT Security:** Embedded systems, CAN bus security, ECU hardening, real-time constraints (engineering teams understand this)
- **AUMOVIO's positioning:** Bridge between IT and OT worlds
- **🔴 FESCARO's positioning:** OT security specialists (automotive embedded systems background) who speak AUMOVIO's language

**"All these different cases" = Service Productization:** AUMOVIO has **standardized service packages** for different customer maturity levels. This means they likely have:

- Standard pricing models
- Repeatable methodologies
- Template deliverables
- **🔴 OPPORTUNITY:** FESCARO products can be **pre-packaged into AUMOVIO's service tiers** (e.g., "Tier 3 Full Service includes AUMOVIO gateway with FESCARO software HSM")

**Jo:** "So among those OEMs, does everyone really understand... oh actually I have to really... like have to start to working on to get the requirement? Or, some people, some of the OEMs are they very like, we have a lot of time, we will consider, you know, these things at the very moment, like the deadline?"

**Benedikt:** "Yeah, that's... I mean, that's a perfect question because there are also... I mean it's December 27 2027, and until then you have a lot of time but not really. Because if you take, for instance, a medium-sized OEM, they have a lot of products. And even if they have several products, every product has to be adapted to the requirements. And this takes time, especially when you not have any processes in place. Even if they have started maybe three or four months ago, the pressure is now high. Because then at one point you have to build up processes, you have to build up your engineering teams - you have to do something, with knowledge or experts or something. And on the other hand there is always cost behind it. And if you want to make it professional and so on, then it's... You can't do it on your own and they are... they have currently running business which they also need to maintain. So these are, let's say, the typical customers - so it's a mixture at the moment. But like we start with all the work. That's what I mean. We are having now here all these days at this fair, we have a lot of different opportunities that we... that are ongoing with customers."

**Critical Market Timing Intelligence:**

**Timeline Reality Check:**

- **CRA Deadline:** December 2027
- **Actual Time Remaining:** 25 months (from November 2025)
- **"Lots of time but not really"** → Urgency starting to build

- "Pressure is now high" = decision paralysis risk
- Need turnkey solutions, not piecemeal consulting
- **FESCARO Opportunity:** AUMOVIO gateway + FESCARO software HSM = **faster time-to-compliance** than building custom solutions

**Very High-Urgency Segment (Haven't Started Yet):**

- Small OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers
- Will face **panic buying** in 2026-2027 as deadline approaches
- Price sensitivity decreases as urgency increases
- **FESCARO Opportunity:** Premium pricing possible for expedited integration

**Cost Concerns:** "On the other hand there is always cost behind it" → **Cost-sensitive buying environment**

- OEMs reluctant to invest heavily in cybersecurity (non-revenue-generating)
- **🔴 PERFECT FIT:** FESCARO software HSM saves money vs. hardware alternatives
- Value proposition: "Achieve compliance while reducing costs" (not typical "compliance costs money" message)

**Ongoing Business Pressure:** "They have currently running business which they also need to maintain"

- CRA compliance competes for resources with product development, sales, operations
- **Implication:** OEMs prefer **outsourced solutions** (AUMOVIO gateway) over in-house development
- **🔴 STRATEGIC:** AUMOVIO gateways with FESCARO software HSM = **no engineering resources required from customer**

**"All these days at this fair, we have a lot of different opportunities":**

- AUMOVIO experiencing high demand at Agritechnica
- Strong sales pipeline being built
- **URGENCY:** FESCARO needs to engage quickly before AUMOVIO's 2025 product roadmap is finalized
- **TARGET:** Influence AUMOVIO's Q1 2026 gateway ECU feature decisions to include software HSM option

- "30-50% BOM cost reduction per gateway unit"
- "Perfect for 15-20 year agricultural machinery lifecycles - software-updatable security"
- "Volume licensing model - attractive economics at your production scale"

**Lesson Learned:** Without understanding AUMOVIO's hardware manufacturing business, Jo's pitch focused on wrong value proposition (consulting partnership instead of direct cost reduction for hardware products).

**Benedikt:** "Yeah, I mean that's... That's always interesting. So, we are also collecting information from everywhere and trying to get things together. Because, I mean, at the end, it's also... it's also like a puzzle that you need to bring together. I mean a secure gateway, that's also something... I mean, again, we have secure gateways, this is what we are producing by ourselves. But there are other also smaller elements and... that we can provide. So, if you have, like, a business card or something..."

**"But there are other also smaller elements":**

- AUMOVIO's gateways don't include everything
- Open to integrating third-party components
- **Software HSM = "smaller element"** that enhances gateway functionality
- **Business Model:** AUMOVIO focuses on gateway platform, partners provide specialized features

**"If you have, like, a business card or something...":**

- **Strong interest signal** - asking for contact information
- Not polite dismissal, genuine follow-up intent
- **Cultural note:** Germans don't ask for business cards unless serious interest
- **🔴 URGENT:** Follow-up window is NOW (within 2-3 weeks of Agritechnica before other priorities dominate)

---

#### **[05:30-07:00] Information Exchange & Closing**

**Jo:** "Yeah, of course, so do you have a business card for me as well?"

**Benedikt:** "Yes, I will grab one. Just give me a second."

[Brief pause for business card exchange]

**Jo:** "So, I will let you know more information or send you like some brochure about the product later on. And if you have any customers in need, please let me know."

**Benedikt:** "Yeah, perfect. Thank you very much."

**Jo:** "Thank you for your time."

**Benedikt:** "You're welcome. Have a nice day."

## PART 5: UPDATED ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Immediate Actions (Week 1: November 21-28, 2025)

**1. Follow-Up Email to Benedikt Müller**

**Timeline:** Within 48-72 hours (by November 24)

**Subject Line:** "FESCARO Software HSM: Cost-Effective Alternative for AUMOVIO Gateway ECUs"

**Email Template:**

```
Benedikt,

Thank you for the excellent conversation at your Agritechnica booth last week. I appreciated learning about AUMOVIO's comprehensive CRA compliance services and your technology transfer experience from Continental's automotive division.

After our discussion, I reviewed AUMOVIO's gateway ECU product line in detail, and I believe FESCARO's software HSM solution offers significant value for your hardware manufacturing business - beyond the consulting partnership opportunities we discussed.

KEY OPPORTUNITY: MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTION

Your Advanced Compact Gateway, Smart Gateway, and High Performance Gateway products currently integrate hardware HSMs from chip suppliers (e.g., NXP S32G). FESCARO's software HSM could provide:

1. **Bill of Materials Savings:** €40-70 per gateway ECU (microcontroller without HSM vs. with HSM)
2. **Product Differentiation:** "Software-upgradeable security" marketing message vs. competitors' fixed hardware HSMs
3. **Lifecycle Management:** Security algorithm updates over 15-20 year agricultural machinery lifecycles (vs. hardware HSM's fixed capabilities)
4. **Proven Track Record:** Deployed in Hyundai/Kia automotive systems, ISO 21434 compliant, ISO 24882 preparation underway

SPECIFIC TECHNICAL FIT FOR AUMOVIO:

- Your Smart Gateway's FOTA capability = perfect infrastructure for software HSM updates
- Your High Performance Gateway's NXP S32G platform = FESCARO has direct porting experience
- Your agricultural division's autonomy = faster decision-making vs. cross-division consensus
- Continental heritage + Korean automotive software = compelling joint value proposition

PROPOSED NEXT STEP:

Would you be open to a 60-minute technical deep-dive meeting to discuss:
- Direct cost comparison: NXP S32G with hardware HSM vs. standard processor + FESCARO software HSM
- Integration approach for your AUTOSAR gateway platforms
- Potential pilot project with one gateway product line
- Flexible business models (per-unit licensing, annual flat fee, or revenue sharing)

I'm based in Munich and available for an in-person meeting at AUMOVIO's offices, or we can arrange a video call if that's more convenient.

Looking forward to exploring this opportunity.

## PART 6: LESSONS LEARNED & BEST PRACTICES

### Why the Initial Analysis Was Incomplete

**Booth Conversation Limitations:**

1. **Role-Based Conversation Bias:**
    
    - Benedikt Müller = Business Development Manager for **Systems Engineering Services**
    - His role focuses on **consulting services**, not hardware manufacturing
    - Naturally emphasized services in conversation (his area of responsibility)
    - **Lesson:** Always ask "What does your company manufacture vs. what services do you provide?"
2. **Vocabulary Ambiguity:**
    
    - "Components" can mean software modules, hardware devices, or consulting frameworks
    - "Secure gateways" mentioned without clarifying "we manufacture physical devices"
    - "HSM" mentioned without specifying "chip-level HSM embedded in our products"
    - **Lesson:** Always clarify technical terms - "When you say [X], do you mean hardware, software, or service?"
3. **Time Constraints:**
    
    - 7-minute booth conversation
    - Surface-level information exchange
    - No product demonstrations or spec sheets reviewed
    - **Lesson:** Booth conversations are **relationship initiators**, not comprehensive intelligence - always follow up with website research, product literature, and deeper technical discussions
4. **Marketing Materials Focus:**
    
    - Booth displays emphasized services (gap analysis, testing, training)
    - Hardware products likely less visible (not "sexy" to showcase in booth format)
    - **Lesson:** Review company website product pages, not just booth materials

### Future Booth Conversation Best Practices

**Essential Questions to Ask (Always):**

1. **Business Model Clarification:**
    
    - "What do you manufacture vs. what services do you provide?"
    - "What's the split between product revenue and service revenue?" (if appropriate to ask)
    - "Who are your customers - do they buy hardware, software, or consulting from you?"
2. **Technical Terminology Clarification:**
    
    - "When you mention [technical term], can you clarify - is that hardware, software, or a service offering?"
    - "Do you develop [technology] in-house or integrate from suppliers?"
    - "Can I see product specifications or technical datasheets?"
3. **Customer Relationship Clarification:**
    
    - "Do you sell directly to OEMs or through distributors?"
    - "What's your typical sales cycle - is this a transactional product or a long-term partnership model?"
    - "Are you open to technology partnerships with component suppliers?"
4. **Decision-Making Authority Clarification:**
    
    - "What's your role in technology selection decisions?"
    - "Who else should I speak with about [specific opportunity]?" (procurement, engineering, product management)
    - "What's your typical process for evaluating new technology partners?"

**Post-Booth Actions (Within 48 Hours):**

1. ✅ **Review company website** (products, services, technical specs)
2. ✅ **LinkedIn research** (key personnel, organizational structure, recent news)
3. ✅ **Financial research** (revenue, funding, growth trajectory - if publicly available)
4. ✅ **Competitive positioning** (who are their competitors, what's unique about them)
5. ✅ **Send follow-up email** (personalized, specific value proposition, clear call-to-action)
