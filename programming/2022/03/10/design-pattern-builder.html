<meta name="description" content="Reference Links Refactoring GURU - Builder Intent Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. Problem The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more. There’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base House class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem. Solution For example, imagine a builder that builds everything from wood and glass, a second one that builds everything with stone and iron and a third one that uses gold and diamonds. By calling the same set of steps, you get a regular house from the first builder, a small castle from the second and a palace from the third. However, this would only work if the client code that calls the building steps is able to interact with builders using a common interface. Director You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps. Having a director class in your program isn’t strictly necessary. You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code. However, the director class might be a good place to put various construction routines so you can reuse them across your program. In addition, the director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code. The client only needs to associate a builder with a director, launch the construction with the director, and get the result from the builder. Structure The Client must associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor. Then the director uses that builder object for all further construction. However, there’s an alternative approach for when the client passes the builder object to the production method of the director. In this case, you can use a different builder each time you produce something with the director.

</ul>

<h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>

<p>Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.</p>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/builder/builder-en.png" alt="image of factory building robots"></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/problem1.png" alt="image of various houses"></p>

<p>The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.</p>

<p>There’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base House class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/problem2.png" alt="create houses with tons of parameters"></p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/builder/builder-comic-1-en-2x.png" alt="image of different builders executing the same task in various ways"></p>

<p>For example, imagine a builder that builds everything from wood and glass, a second one that builds everything with stone and iron and a third one that uses gold and diamonds. By calling the same set of steps, you get a regular house from the first builder, a small castle from the second and a palace from the third. However, this would only work if the client code that calls the building steps is able to interact with builders using a common interface.</p>

<h3 id="director">Director</h3>

<p>You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/builder/builder-comic-2-en-2x.png" alt="image of director that knows building steps"></p>

<p>Having a director class in your program isn’t strictly necessary. You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code. However, the director class might be a good place to put various construction routines so you can reuse them across your program.</p>

<p>In addition, the director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code. The client only needs to associate a builder with a director, launch the construction with the director, and get the result from the builder.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/structure-2x.png" alt="image of builder and director"></p>

<p>The Client must associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor. Then the director uses that builder object for all further construction. However, there’s an alternative approach for when the client passes the builder object to the production method of the director. In this case, you can use a different builder each time you produce something with the director.</p>

<h2 id="pseudocode">Pseudocode</h2>

<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/example-en-2x.png" alt="image of car builder and director"></p>

<pre><code class="language-pseudocode">
// Using the Builder pattern makes sense only when your products
// are quite complex and require extensive configuration. The
// following two products are related, although they don't have
// a common interface.
class Car is
    // A car can have a GPS, trip computer and some number of
    // seats. Different models of cars (sports car, SUV,

class Manual is
    // Each car should have a user manual that corresponds to

    method setGPS(...)

// The concrete builder classes follow the builder interface and
// provide specific implementations of the building steps. Your
// program may have several variations of builders, each
// implemented differently.
class CarBuilder implements Builder is
    private field car:Car

    // A fresh builder instance should contain a blank product
    // object which it uses in further assembly.

    method setGPS(...) is

    // methods can't be declared in the builder interface (at
    // least not in a statically-typed programming language).
    //
    // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a
    // builder instance is expected to be ready to start
    // producing another product. That's why it's a usual
    // practice to call the reset method at the end of the
    // `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior isn't
    // mandatory, and you can make your builder wait for an
    // explicit reset call from the client code before disposing
    // of the previous result.

<h2 id="how-to-implement">How to Implement</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clearly define the common construction steps for building all available product representations</li>
  <li>Declare these steps in the base builder interface.</li>
  <li>Create a concrete builder class
    <ul>
      <li>for each of the product representations and</li>
      <li>implement their construction steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t forget about implementing a method for fetching the result of the construction
        <ul>
          <li>various builders may construct products that don’t have a common interface. Therefore, you don’t know what would be the return type for such a method.</li>
          <li>However, if you’re dealing with products from a single hierarchy, the fetching method can be safely added to the base interface.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a director class. It may encapsulate various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.</li>
  <li>Before construction starts, the client must pass a builder object to the director. Usually, the client does this only once, via parameters of the director’s constructor.
    <ul>
      <li>There’s an alternative approach, where the builder is passed directly to the construction method of the director.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The construction result can be obtained directly from the director only if all products follow the same interface. Otherwise, the client should fetch the result from the builder.</li>

<h2 id="relations-with-other-patterns">Relations with Other Patterns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many designs start by using <strong>Factory Method</strong> (less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward <strong>Abstract Factory</strong>, <strong>Prototype</strong>, or <strong>Builder</strong> (more flexible, but more complicated).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Builder</strong> focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> specializes in creating families of related objects. <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> returns the product immediately, whereas <strong>Builder</strong> lets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can use <strong>Builder</strong> when creating complex <strong>Composite</strong> trees because you can program its construction steps to work recursively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can combine <strong>Builder</strong> with <strong>Bridge</strong>: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstract Factories</strong>, <strong>Builders</strong> and <strong>Prototypes</strong> can all be implemented as <strong>Singletons</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
