<h2>About</h2>

<p>
From 2013 to 2022, I was an automotive software engineer specializing in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems at the Vehicle Solutions company of LG Electronics. During the period, I contributed to the development and production of lane detection algorithms for Mercedes Benz mono cameras for NCAP 2020+, which means I was involved in the development of the project from start to finish. Since 2022, I have been a senior software engineer with the HiL/SiL systems at DXC Luxoft company. My research interests include software architecture, design pattern, vision-based automation and sensor fusion system.
